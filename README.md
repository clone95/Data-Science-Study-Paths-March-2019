Studying through the Internet means swimming in an infinite ocean of information. 

Have you ever felt overwhelmed when trying to approach a new subject without a real “path” to follow? Were you hindered from obtaining deep knowledge and the ability to apply it?

Hi, I'm Giacomo. 

I'm an Italian student currently working at a Machine Learning / AI startup in Bologna.
My boss asked me if it was possible to create a study path for newcomers and myself, so I have contributed all my years of browsing around the internet for resources here. I have collected **sources, projects, tools, tutorials, links, best practices, and organized them in an useful way**.

This repository is intended to provide three **complete learning paths** for the following fields:

- Machine Learning

- Business Intelligence (coming soon)

- Cloud Computing (coming soon)



I have collected in-depth guides about **Specializations** and **Tools**. They are optional but highly recommended, because will need them to expand your skillset and expertise.


By carefully following this guide, you will gain learn to understand and apply theory with hands-on projects.

You do not require any prior knowledge of machine learning, but be confident with programming and high school math to understand and implement most of the concepts.

Every source listed here is **free or open source**. 

I tried to be concise to _avoid information overhead_.

I organized the content hierarchically and by the level of complexity to give you a _coherent idea_ of how things work.   

Click on "watch" to see new updates that I post in my free time or on the weekends.

If you want to contact me, email me at giacomo.ciarlini@student.unife.it 

The second guide (Business Intelligence) should be out in 2 or 3 weeks!

# About Specializations

You can read them in order or choose the one that fits you the most, but **I recommend you** to walk through all of them at least once.

I've planned two types of Specializations: 

- Data Specializations 
  - Data Preprocessing  [Already Out!]
  - Data Collection  [Coming Soon - Next]
  - Data Visualization  [Coming Soon]
  

- Soft Skills Specializations 
  - Effective Communication  [Coming Soon]
  - Impactful Presentations  [Coming Soon]
  - Pragmatic Decision Making  [Coming Soon]

Data specialization is _the core toolkit_ for everyone working with data. Working with data is an art form, and the rules of thumb  will help you understand the way to deal with data. You need to develop a "sense" of what to do with the data, this "sense" is primarily driven by situation and experience. As a result, these specializations will be strongly focused on exercises and practice.

Soft skills specialization is about everything that's not written in technical books. Use them and master it, because they are the real _value enabler_ for you. You can be the best developer or engineer in the world, but if you can't communicate your data to your audience, or use data to suggest practical action in the real world, you're useless for a company. 

Stay tuned because I'm still building this section and hoping to provide you **one specialization each week!**

As usual, feel free to suggest improvements and collaborations :)

# About Tools

Anyone can commit their own guides as long as they follow the style I've chosen. Also I'm proud to announce that very soon the Tools Sections will host several guides about every particular technology/language/methodology! I've already planned a guide on Latex and one about ElasticSearch! So stay tuned!

You can [**already find here**](Tools/Latex.md) a cool Latex guide for beginners!


This is the **roadmap** of the coming guides (the **Machine Learning one is already out**).
